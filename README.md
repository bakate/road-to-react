# A Create-React-App with Material-Ui to display pic and vids from Pexels

Hello, I'm trying through this project to use different skills required in order to be a good react Developer.


## `What you will find`

I've divided the *src* directory within different directories:

1. Components, where you'll find Material-Ui components and some reusable ones
1. Lib, where you'll find logic to fetch data, bu the way I'll use Pexels api
1. State-Management, where you'll find Context
1. Pages where you'll find different pages to print

I'm using different libs such as react-router-dom and I've created a **private route** depending whether the person is logged in or not. I store data in localStorage.

I've also implemented the dark mode with Material-Ui thanks to Context
